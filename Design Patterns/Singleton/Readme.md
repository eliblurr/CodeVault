# Singleton Design Pattern

Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Why is singleton design pattern important
- Control access to some shared resource. .eg: database connection or a file
- Can be used to encapsulate instances. .eg: configuration object
